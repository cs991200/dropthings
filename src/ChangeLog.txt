==============
FIX: Fixed the logic where widgets on a column is pushed down when an widget is dropped on a column.
FIX: Performance problem on DropthingsDataContext2 where in the constructor it tries to initialize all the Entity sets with MergeOption = NoTracking. It makes the ObjectContext to initialize all the entity sets and thus causing high CPU. Solved it by making Query<> function to execute the compiled queries using NoTracking. 
CHANGE: Create Facade and register in Container only once per request and reuse that same instance within the request. This reuses ObjectContext and all repository instances.
